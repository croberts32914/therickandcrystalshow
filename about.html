  </p> <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sometimes we want to give up, but we learn to pick ourselves up from the ground, wipe 
     our tears and try again. Although it may be comfortable to remain in the bubble you were born into,
     the role you were expected to fulfill; you will undoubtedly find that role unsatisfying as this was 
     not the role, in your heart which you believed was your purpose.</span>

  <br>
  <p>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Like everyone, Rick and Crystal have a story... Their story triumphs with God, love, understanding, forgiveness and
     a desire to help others in need, but that’s not how it first started...
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rick and Crystal have struggled with many tragic and stressful situations 
     in their lifetimes. Some things that have happened they never thought they would emotionally 
     recover from. One of the most tragic, life changing events, that happened in Rick's life was when
     he lost his spouse of 22 years. He was a widower of 3 boys when he met Crystal in 2013. She 
     was a divorced mother of two boys often in court for various custody issues. 
     
     
     
     sexual abuse, physical abuse, custody battles over Crystal's children, attempted suicides, 
     Crystal's struggles with her bipolar diagnosis, his DUI and loss of career, 
     both recovered from past drug and alcohol abuse, 
     loss of loved ones, and family whom have suffered tragic deaths from suicide, accidental OD, and murder,
    but Rick and Crystal didn't want to live as victims, they wanted what every other person
    desires. They needed to find peace, happiness, joy, and security. What they needed was God.

         Romans 3:23, in the Bible says <i>"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God". </i></h6></center> ></span>
     <br>
     <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We all have our own personal cross to bear, as they say and Rick and Crystal are no exception.
     They both have ultimately made some bad decisions in their past which not only affected their
     present but future as well. </p>
     <br>
     <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Their sins were overcoming them, they were drowning, sinking but grasping for 
     a moment of peace, just a moment would be nice they both had thought.
     Lying to themselves, hiding their pain, falling into the socially acceptable, lure of alcohol
     and its lifestyle until Rick had been drinking one night and got a DUI and lost his license,
     his freedom, his career, and truck, what had appeared to be almost everything. But something
     unexpected happened...<br>
     <br>

      Rick and Crystal began not only seeking truth and understanding, of who they were and why 
      they had become the people they had; but they wanted to improve their quality of life, someway, somehow. They
      believed they could naturally alter their perception of reality by gaining knowledge and understanding of 
      things such as: self, society, politics and creation. Before then, up until that <span class="w3-tag"> <i>bad</span></i> day, 
      they unknowingly were existing in a slumber, but until someone is aware there is a problem,
      there will never be a solution. For Rick and Crystal, that bad night had a good outcome...
      because it saved them, 
      their marriage and their family. That night saved their LIVES!
